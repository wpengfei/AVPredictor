EnderUNIX Aget ChangeLog

* Fri Nov 22 07:44:20 EET 2002
  Version 0.4 adds/changes the following:
  - Fixed bugs in Resume code.

  - Fixed miscalculations in the progress indicator 

* Fri Sep 20 18:11:11 EEST 2002
  Version 0.39 adds/changes the following:
  - Hafiye is not 100 % POSIX compliant now.
    pread/pwrite functions are now used to 
    simultaneously write to the local file.

  - Because of pwrite, the local file is not
    assembled at the end now, it's assembled
    at the same time. This speeds up large
    downloads; since previously lots of I/O was used
    to assemble the file. This is now decreased by
    at least fifty percent.
    
  - Solaris bug fixed.

  - Resume support. 

  - Some more options:
    -p	[port number to connect to]
    -l  [local file name, if different from the remote file]
    -f  [force use of suggested number of threads]

  - A progress indicator has been added.

  - Code has been re-arranged. Since aget starts
    to become larger, that was a need.

  - A README-Developer has been added for
    developers who want to contribute to aget.

  - getopt() problem is now solved,
    The program should really run on Posix systems.
    I've tested it on Linux, FreeBSD ans Solaris.

  - A Solaris Makefile is added to the tarball.

  Version 0.2 adds/changes the following:
  - File is now created seperately in each thread
    and later, it is assembled.
