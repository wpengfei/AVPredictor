EnderUNIX Aget v0.4 INSTALL
--------------------------

The program is tested on RedHat Linux 7.2 (gcc-2.96), FreeBSD 4.5
and Solaris 8. For Solaris, you'll have to use Makefile.Solaris.

To compile Aget, type:

# make  && make strip

To install the compiled binary, type:

# make install 

and binary will be installed as /usr/local/bin/aget

You're done. All you need is a file to download and supply
that url and desired number of segments to aget, e.g:

$ aget -n10 http://www.enderunix.org/murat/barismanco-hibrahimsofrasi.mp3 

Aget will split the file into 10 segments and will download it for you.
